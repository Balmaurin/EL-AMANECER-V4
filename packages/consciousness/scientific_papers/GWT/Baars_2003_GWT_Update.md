## Key Concepts

### The Brainweb
The idea that consciousness has an integrative function. Francisco Varela and colleagues called it the "brainweb" (2002).

**Global Workspace theory** suggests a **fleeting memory capacity** that enables **access between brain functions** that are otherwise separate.

### The Architecture
- **Massive parallel distributed system** of highly specialized processors
- **Coordination and control** via a central information exchange
- Specialized processors (e.g., sensory systems) **distribute information** to the system as a whole
- Shows typical **"limited capacity"** behavior when information flows by way of a global workspace

## Table 1: Brain Capacities Enabled by Conscious Events

1. **Conscious perception** enables access to widespread brain sources; unconscious sensory processing is much more limited.

2. **Conscious perception, inner speech, and visual imagery** enable working memory functions; there is no evidence for unconscious access to working memory.

3. **Conscious events** enable almost all kinds of learning: episodic and explicit learning, but also implicit and skill learning.

4. **Conscious perceptual feedback** enables voluntary control over motor functions, and perhaps over any neuronal population and even single neurons.

5. **Conscious contents** can evoke selective attention.

6. **Consciousness** enables access to "self" -- executive interpreters, located in part in the frontal cortex.

## Convergence of Ideas (Table 2)

Multiple scientists independently arrived at similar concepts:

- **Baars, 1983**: "Conscious contents provide the nervous system with coherent, global information."

- **Edelman, 1989**: Global mapping in a reentrant selectionist model of consciousness

- **Dennett, 2001**: "Theorists are converging from quite different quarters on a version of the global neuronal workspace model"

- **Kanwisher, 2001**: "awareness must entail not just a strong enough neural representation, but also **access to that information by most of the rest of the mind/brain**"

- **Dehaene & Naccache, 2001**: "the global availability of information through the workspace is what we subjectively experience as the conscious state"

- **Edelman & Tononi, 2000**: "When we become aware of something... it is as if, suddenly, many different parts of our brain were privy to information that was previously confined to some specialized subsystem"

- **Llinas et al, 1998**: "the thalamus represents a hub from which any site in the cortex can communicate with any other such site"

- **Varela et al, 2001**: "the brain... transiently settling into a globally consistent state.... the basis for the unity of mind"

- **Damasio, 1989**: "Meaning is reached by time-locked multiregional retroactivation of widespread fragment records"

## Theater Metaphor & Brain Hypotheses

### The Theater
- **Bright spot on stage** = consciousness in immediate memory
- **Spotlight of attention** = directed by executive guidance
- **Rest of theater** = dark and unconscious

### Neural Implementation

**Sensory Consciousness:**
- Requires sensory projection areas of cortex
- Different modalities may be mutually inhibitory (~100ms cycles)
- Can be activated internally (inner speech, imagery) or externally

**Global Broadcasting:**
- Once conscious, sensory content is distributed widely
- Uses corticocortical and corticothalamic fibers
- Reaches "audience" of expert networks

**Primary Function:**
- Allow theater architecture to operate in brain
- Integrate, provide access, and coordinate large numbers of specialized networks

### Components

#### 1. Inner Speech & Imagery
- **Inner speech**: Left hemisphere language areas
- **Visual imagery**: Visual cortex
- Broadcast globally to influence action

#### 2. Attentional Spotlight
- Selective attention system
- Dual control:
  - Frontal executive cortex
  - Automatic interrupt (brainstem, pain, amygdala)

#### 3. Context vs. Content
- **Content**: Ventral visual pathway (what)
- **Context**: Dorsal visual pathway (where/spatial domain)
- Parietal cortex: allocentric & egocentric spatial maps
- **Damaged content** = noticeable missing experience
- **Damaged context** = anosognosia (don't know what's missing)

#### 4. Self-Systems
- Maintain constancy across perceptual situations
- **Left hemisphere "narrative interpreter"** (Gazzaniga)
  - Uses speech to talk to self
  - Rationalizes/reinterprets conflicts
  - Higher-level context system
  
- **Right hemisphere**:
  - Non-verbal
  - Handles irony, jokes, emotional sophistication
  - Understands figurative language

**Full consciousness may not exist without prefrontal self systems**

## Key Predictions

**GW theory predicted conscious contents are widely distributed** (now confirmed by brain evidence)

## Critical Brain Areas

1. **Thalamus**: Central hub for cortical communication
2. **Sensory cortices**: Content generation
3. **Parietal cortex**: Spatial context
4. **Prefrontal cortex**: Executive control, self-systems
5. **Temporal coordination**: Alpha-gamma oscillations
6. **Amygdala**: Emotional interrupts
7. **Basal ganglia**: Automatic action systems

## Integration Points for Implementation

### With IIT 4.0
- IIT determines **what** is conscious (Φ > threshold)
- GWT determines **how** it's distributed (global broadcast)
- **Synergy**: Integrated distinctions (IIT) compete for workspace access (GWT)

### With FEP
- Predictive coding in specialized processors
- Error minimization drives attention
- Workspace broadcasts prediction errors

### With SMH
- Emotional markers influence workspace competition
- vmPFC provides somatic markers as context
- Damasio's "multiregional retroactivation" aligns with GWT broadcast

### Implementation Architecture

```
Specialized Processors (Unconscious)
    ↓ (compete for access)
Global Workspace (Conscious - limited capacity)
    ↓ (broadcast)
All Processors (receive broadcast)
    ↓ (influence next cycle)
Executive Systems (shape workspace)
```
